In the event of an error,
1) tiny.sdkmesh did not copy to AppX\\Assets\\
for each Debug/Release x86/x64 combination
2) SegoeUI_18.spritefont and segoeui.ttf
did not copy to the AppX folder for
Debug/Release x64.
3) SegoeUI_18.spritefont and segoeui.ttf
did not copy to the Debug/Release folder for
Debug/Release x86.

Manually copy those folders from App1\\Assets to 
these above locations and it is magic!
