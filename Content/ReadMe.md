# To Change the Content of the Scene is Easy and it is the same in all of my Xaml Apps in my repositories

## 1) Add an object and an effect in the function:
### SceneRender::CreateDeviceDependentResources()
{

}

## 2) Add the Appropriate objects you added to the function
### void SceneRender::OnDeviceLost()
{

}

## 3) Add the objects to the Function
### bool SceneRender::Render()

There are all sorts of precompiled effects and shaders to choose from
You can add your own textures in the Assets section
